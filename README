To install this to your system:

# python setup.py install

This will install the library on your system, as well as a script which can be run like this:

$ fantasy_stats -c /path/to/ftracker.conf

where ff.conf looks like this (this is example is in the conf directory):

[main]
url: http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/gamenum
yahoologin: user
yahoopasswd: pass

You can also use the API directly, the script is a good example of the usage.
